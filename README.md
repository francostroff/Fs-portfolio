# FS Design Portfolio
## Building a website to showcase some works I've done as a freelancer.
This is part of Module 2 Bootcamp and the challenge is to build a portfolio page with what I've learnt until now.

## What I've done in order to complete the challenge:
Used HTML for structure and CSS for styling the website.
Learnt how to use flexbox and grid in order to make a website responsive.
Apply my own graphic samples to enrich the website design.
Applied some simple css code found on the web for hover transitions.
